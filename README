We're building an open source laser tag platform using the WiiRemote, Arduino enabled phones w/ OpenRTMS.  

The following is a repository of scripts that we are stitching together in the process. We've got a LucidChart account that will help describe how to set up the IR LEDs

Cheers and it is an honor to have your eyes on the project :)
